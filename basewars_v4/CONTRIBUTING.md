#About contributing

If you see this file, you should have full push permissions on this repo. If you don't, contact an administrator.
Feel free to clone the repo and make changes. Make sure you ask around before you commit to make sure
your code works as intended. Getting it checked by someone else never hurts.

We would also like to ask you to not share anything of this gamemode with someone that doesn't have atleast read access to this repo.

Everyone that has ever contributed in any way will be put on a list, thanking them for their support. (TODO!)
